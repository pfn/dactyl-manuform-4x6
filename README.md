# My keymap for the Dactyl Manuform 4x6

This should be evolving as I learn to use the keyboard more. It would be
very ideal if I could figure out how to make using the symbols and numpad
layer (especially the brackets: `()[]{}` more seamless). Right now, "context"
switching to these layers feels like it puts a pretty big dent in my typing
flow.

Features:

* QWERTY with a variation of homerow mods
* Compatible with editing in QMK configurator
* a CAPS WORD implementation
* `shift<space>` to get underscore
* `shift<backspace>` to get del
* symbols layer
* numpad layer
* arrow nav layer
* mouse nav layer
